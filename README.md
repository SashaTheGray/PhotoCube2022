This repository contains 3 directories:
- LSC-MMM Mapping
- PhotoCube
- Server performance measurement

## LSC-MMM Mapping

This directory contains Java programs, that transform Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) dataset. The goal is to map the LSC data to Multi-dimensional Media Model (M-cube).

The input files are deleted based on the LSC data usage terms.

## PhotoCube

This version of PhotoCube is implemented to better support the participation in the Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC).

## Server performance measurement

This directory contains a python script to measure the performance of PhotoCube's server.
